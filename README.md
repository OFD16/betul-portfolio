```
flutter run -d edge

if i need to update my routes i need to run this command and update app_router.gr.dart file
```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

## Issues
lib > components > expander_card.dart > _ExpanderCardState > onExit
- [TO DO]() It gets buggy when I enter and exit endlessly and wait on it, but then it gets resolved when I wait outside and enter again.
