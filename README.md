# betul_portfolio

This is a BetÃ¼l's -My dear- portfolio web site repo.

## Getting Started and run on Edge
```
flutter run -d edge
```
## I used - [auto_route](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route/example) package 
if i need to update my routes i need to run this command and update app_router.gr.dart file
```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

## Issues
lib > components > expander_card.dart > _ExpanderCardState > onExit
- [TO DO]() It gets buggy when I enter and exit endlessly and wait on it, but then it gets resolved when I wait outside and enter again.
